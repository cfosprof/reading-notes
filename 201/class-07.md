### 1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

A well defined model can clearly communicte a specific problem amongst multiple people so they can all come together to attack the same problem rather than their own specific understanding of the problem. It's like emotional granularity, but in computer literacy rather than emotional literacy.l

## HTML Table Basics

### 2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?]

They reduce accessability for visually impaired users, have confusing tag structures, and are not automatically responsive to their parent elements.

### 3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

`<thead>` defines the major header group, which contains one or more rows. `<caption>` which gives the table caption, and `<tbody>` groups the body content in a table. its used in conjuction with `<td>` which defines data cells.`<th>` also defines a header cell in a table. `<td>` defines a data cell.

## Introducing Constructors

### 4. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

They're a function that can reduce repeating the same information for each object in a group of related objects and reduce the chances of forgetting to update all objects when changing some information.

### 5. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

In literals `this` refers to the object itself, in a constructor it refers to the new object being created.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
