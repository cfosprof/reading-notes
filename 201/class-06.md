## Reading Objectives

<details markdown="block"><summary>Prompt Questions/answers</summary>


### 1.How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

an object is basically a collection of data. Much like a box holding multiple items and we can access those items through calling the box.

### 2.What are some advantages to creating object literals?

They're easy to create, readable, flexible and contain any data type, reusable, and dynamic.

### 3.How do objects differ from arrays?

Arrays are ordered lists of valuies where each item is accessible by index, where as objects are key value pairs.

### 4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

When trying to access a dynamic value stored in a value in an objects properties.

### 5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

```js
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```

`this` refers to the object dog, and it makes the function more flexible and reusable. 

### 6. What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM)

### 7. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

Javascript manipulates the element within the DOM to chang webpages.

Use curly braces and comma separated key value pairs

functions that are stored in objects are reffered to as methods

```js
let myArr = ['Chris', 31, true 'student'];

let person = {
  name: 'Chris',
  age: 31,
  isRemote: true,
  title: 'Student',
}
```

calling functions

dot notation:
`object.key`

or 

bracket notation
["Is Remote"]

assigning values

`person.interests = ['celebs', 'tattoos', 'art']`;


```js



```
