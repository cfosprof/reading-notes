 **Describe a DAO in your own words**
 
 A class that provides access to a database. DAOs are typically used to perform operations such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting data from a database. DAOs are often used in conjunction with an ORM, such as Room, to make it easier to access data from a database.

**Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?**

Yes

What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?


Room is wrapped around the SQLite database engine. SQLite is a lightweight, open-source, and cross-platform database engine that is well-suited for mobile applications. It provides a good solution for data persistance that is light and fast.
