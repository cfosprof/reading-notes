Until the part about packaging.

Creating a project
Exploring the project structure
Creating a package and a class
Writing code for the HelloWorld class

<details markdown="block"><summary>Debugging Java</summary>

Follow through all the directions in every section of this page.

Before you startâ€¦
Putting breakpoints
Starting a debugger session
Stepping through the application
Stepping through the statements directly
Stepping through the method calls

</details>

<details markdown="block"><summary>Submitting Your Work</summary>

Capture screenshots of your code and its output. Consolidate them into a folder and submit it into the Canvas assignment designated for the Java Tutorial prework.

Capture screenshots of you debugging your code. Write something offering your own definitions and explanations for each of these debugging concepts:

Breakpoint
Step-to-next-line
Step-inside-function-call
Step-out-of-function-call

Java is OOP
<details markdown="block"><summary>Example</summary>

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

```

## Introductory

`public` - can be accessed from anywhere
`static` - can be accessed without creating an instance of the class
`void` - does not return anything
`main` - the entry point of the program
`System` - a pre-defined class in java that holds useful methods and variables
`System.out` - a static variable within system that represents the standard output of the program
`println` - a method that can be used to print a line

## Variables and Types

## Conditionals

## Arrays

## Functions

## Objects

## Compiling and Running with Arguments

## Inheritance

## Try and Catch

## Abstract Classes

## Interfaces

* Java = OOP

* Java objects are part of so called classes

* Every line in java that can actually be run needs to be in a  class. This is because java is an OOP language.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}


public class Main {//class name and public means any other class can access it
    public static void main(String[] args) {// this is the entry point of the program.
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

* public means that any other class can access it.
* static means you can run the method without creating an instance of the Main class.
* void means that the method does not return anything.
* main is the name of the method.
* The arguments we get inside the method are the arguments taht we will get when we run the program with parameters.

* `System` is a pre-defined class in java that holds useful methods and variables.

* System`.out` is a statc variable within system that represents the standard output of the program.

* `println` is a method that can be used to print a line.

* We must declare a public class with the same name as the file name.
