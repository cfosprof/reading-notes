<details markdown="block"><summary>Arrow Functions</summary>

* Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this` `arguments` or `super`, and should not be used as methods.

* Arrows cannnot be used as constructers, callling them with new throws a type error.

* Cannot use yield within their body.

```javascript

() => expression

param => expression

(param) => expression

(param1, paramN) => expression

() => {
  statements
}

param => {
  statements
}

(param1, paramN) => {
  statements
}
