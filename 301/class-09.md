## Introduction To Events.

### 4.How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events are interactions. They're the if to the if then statement. If user clicks, then you need a click action.

### 5.When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

The name of the event we want to register this handler for, and the code that comprises the handler function.

### 6.Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

It just holds the properties and objects meant to handle the event detected by the event listener. If this target event happens then this is how we can handle it.

### 7.What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event capturing involves capturing the event at the top of the dom hierarchy, and then propagate it down through the hierarchy until it reaches the target element that triggered the event. event bubbling involves propagating the event up throguh the dom hierarchy until it reaches the top of the dom hierarchy.
