### 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error is a type of error that occurs when there is some form of error in your syntax or structure, a logic error is one that is in the logic of your code. Syntax errors are usually easier to detect, logic are not.

### 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I've forgottent to use let a few times, and have been forced to read through the code only to find out it was something simple. I also have a bad habit of changing variable naems without changing them everywhere and I'll go through all variables really slowly to find the error.


### 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Errors will affect me forever, I can only hope to get better at reading the error codes and finding out where I make them without losing too much time.


The JavaScript Debugger.

### 4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The javascript Debugger is a tool that allows you to take your code apart in functioning units to test individually so you can see which unit is the problem, rather than testing everysingle line throughout the code one by one.

### 5. Define what a breakpoint is.

Places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

### 6. What is the call stack?

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
